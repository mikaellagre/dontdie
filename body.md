# Blueprint - Hair
Start early and be proactive - I made the mistake of addressing my hair loss and graying after noticing it. By age 20, about 20% of men already have some visible hair loss. Many people lose up to 50% of their hair before they start to notice thinning. By age 50, up to 40% of women will have noticeable hair loss. Consider starting a hair health protocol before you can visibly detect loss. 
Nutrition - proper nutrition is important for hair health. You’ll want to make sure you’re getting adequate protein, Omega-3 fatty acids, Biotin (Vitamin B7), Vitamin C, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, Iron, Zinc and Biotin. The Blueprint stack has all of these. 
Topical hair formulation - I use a topical solution, 1 mL applied to my scalp each morning (before bed is ok too). I then massage my scalp with a silicon scrubber for 1-2 minutes to stimulate blood flow. The formulation I use (listed below) is based upon a genetic test I completed (Blueprint 30% off) that predicted my response to various ingredients. The company then provides you with your custom Rx formulation. 
Note I experimented with applying the topical 2x a day (morning and night) and my recent blood results showed my DHT levels too low at 5.8 ng/dL which can create side effects. I’m back at 1x daily and will retest my blood in 90 days. 
If you’re on a budget or just want a basic solution, you can try out Minoxidil 5%. Note that some people experience side effects with a topical such as itchy skin, headaches etc. so monitor for those. 
The ingredients in my formulation: Minoxidil (7%), Cetirizine HCl (1%), Latanoprost (0.004%), Dutasteride (0.25%), Melatonin (0.1%), Caffeine (0.2%), Tretinoin (0.0125%), Vitamin D3 (1,000IU/ML), Vitamin E (10 IU/ML). 
Red light cap - six minutes a day and you can be doing your morning routine as you wear it. Here’s one option for you (Blueprint for 20% off). 
Oral Minoxidil - I take 3.75 mg a day. I started with 2.5 mg and evaluated for side effects. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial involving 90 men with androgenetic alopecia AGA, oral minoxidil (5 mg daily) was found to have similar efficacy to topical minoxidil (5% solution applied twice daily) after 24 weeks. Oral minoxidil is generally considered safe at low doses, but it can have side effects. Common side effects include hypertrichosis (excessive hair growth) and headaches. 
If you want to start oral Minoxidil, you can get the Rx from our friend Dr. Marjon Vatanchi, Irvine Dermatology. 949-800-8551, Concierge@irvinedermatology.com. 
Gray hair reversal - I’ve been using this product (7% discount “Blueprint”) and have seen good results reversing my gray hair. I was around 70% gray and now about 30% gray. Others have told me that it didn’t do anything for them.  If you try it, please share your results so that we have more of us learning of its efficacy. 
Blueprint hair health shampoo is possibly coming soon. We’ve been trailing this formulation and think it’s the best out there. We need to complete our assessment and if it passes, we’ll make it available to you later this year. 
Blueprint hair treatment is also in the works - I was doing PRP and PRF, where you draw blood and then separate out the plasma and then reinject the plasma back into your scalp. After diligently doing it for 12 months, we saw nearly no benefit. That stinks because it’s painful, expensive and time consuming. Seems PRP works for some but not all.  So we turned our attention to another method that we’re excited about. We are completing our final assessment on this too and if it passes, will also be released later this year. 
This protocol has worked remarkably well for me. That said, I know many people take oral finasteride and have good results. Luckily I’ve been able to avoid it and the risk of its side effects. 
As with any new therapy, you’ll want to monitor for side effects. I’m doing multiple things simultaneously but that doesn’t mean you need to. Topical minoxidil 5% may be the only thing you need for good results. My objective is to openly share what I’m experimenting with so that you can decide what’s right for you.  We’re still in the early days of anti-aging and likely know far less than we think we know. It’s helpful to remain humble. 
A final note that I’m in touch with several companies that are building novel hair regrowth therapies. They are promising and exciting. They’re still years out but it’s cool to think that hair loss may no longer be a thing we have to think about. Just one reason why the future is going to be amazing. #dontdie
Good luck to you friends. Wishing you each the best in maintaining a full head of vibrant hair.

# Blueprint - Skin
Is skincare about looking good? 
Skincare is important because our skin is the first line of defense against the outside world. Healthy skin protects us from infection, regulates our body temperature, and even helps us feel sensations. Poor skin health can lead to a host of problems, from premature aging to serious health issues like skin cancer. Skin cancer can be a real and dangerous consequence of excessive sun exposure without protection. Taking care of your skin isn’t just about looking good—it’s about staying healthy. Looking your best is a great secondary benefit.
 
## The basics
This may seem like a long list but they’re really all habits that you’ll soon forget you’re doing. 
- Get sunlight early in the mornings and later in the afternoons
- Avoid direct sun exposure when the UV index is high (10 am - 4 pm)
- If in the sun during high UV times, use a UV umbrella or wear a hat + mineral sunscreen
- Prioritize your sleep
- And eat a healthy diet
- Avoid junk/fried/highly processed foods.
- Consume 20-30 grams of collagen peptides daily. It’s good to pair Vitamin C with peptides, which the Blueprint stack has. Also, Blueprint collagen peptides are coming soon.
- Supplements: Niacinamide (15 mg in Blueprint Essential Capsules) and hyaluronic acid (120 mg in Blueprint Longevity Mix)


## My daily protocol
- AM face wash morning & night. (Link)
- Moisturize: (Body, Face)
- Sunscreen
- Creams - a few worth considering: niacinamide, vitamin C, hyaluronic acid and tretinoin (an Rx). There are seemingly endless skin cream options to choose from and my experience has been that they are only marginally helpful. If you find one that is meaningfully effective, please share! Note: if you have your face wash or moisturizer that you like, great. The above are options. 

## Pro tips
- Other UV Protection: UV-tinted windows (blocks 99% of UV) and a UV umbrella when outside.
- Prescription: I microdose Accutane (40mg weekly) for blemish free skin and anti-aging benefits. Requires a doctor’s prescription. Alternatives include over-the-counter retinols. (Link)
- Red Light Therapy: Three 12-minute full body sessions per week for collagen production, healing, and mitochondrial health. Note, if you don’t have easy access to red light therapy, don’t worry. The basics are a great place to start.

## Measuring skin health
We measure my progress and tailor treatments with Multispectral Imaging. It provides detailed views of skin health, tracking UV damage, pore size, and spots. Reveals much more than the eyes can see. Some wellness clinics offer this service, you can search locally to find one.

## Advanced Protocols 
Some advanced therapies we have been experimenting with to target collagen production, skin firmness, and overall skin health.

### Some examples  
- Cream: Trialing Adipeau for facial fat for cell rejuvenation. Awaiting results.
- Exilis: Radio frequency for collagen and tightening. Good option.
- Tixel: Thermal mechanical ablation for improved skin firmness and collagen production. Grade: best combination of safety and efficacy.
- IPL: Full body sessions to invite younger genetic expression. Grade: promising.

With this you’ll be off to a great start.


## Sunlight is good
Sunlight helps the skin produce vitamin D. This is good for bones and immune health. It can increase serotonin, a hormone that promotes mood and calmness. Natural light helps regulate our circadian rhythm which improves sleep quality.

## Sunlight is bad
UV rays from the sun break down collagen and elastin. This leads to wrinkles, sagging, and general skin aging.
Large amounts of UV also increase the risk of skin cancers, such as melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma.

## Tips to get the good without the bad
- Get sun exposure when the UV index is below 3; early mornings and late afternoons.
- Don’t get burned.
- When the UV index is >4, wear a hat or use a UV umbrella.
- Use a UV light in the morning to promote your circadian rhythm without the sun. I use a 10k Lux Carex lamp.
- You can supplement your Vitamin D levels. I take 2,000 IU daily.
- Use sunscreen that protects against UVA and UVB. I use EltaMD.
- Use a mineral sunscreen if possible.
- A burn is potentially more dangerous than a chemical sunscreen. Try to avoid both.
- If you dislike sunscreen, refer to 1, 2, and 3.
