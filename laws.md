# Blueprint - Laws
Hi friends - after having poor health habits as a kid, running myself into the ground from 20 years of building companies, and a decade of chronic depression, now, at the chronological age of 46, my health biomarkers are in the top 1%.

And not just the top 1% of 46 year olds, but on some of my markers, such as my cardiovascular fitness, I’m in the top 1% of 18 year olds.

- Top 1%: Speed of aging
- Top 1%: Muscle mass function
- Top 1%: Fat mass
- Top 1%: Inflammation
- Top 1%: Cardiovascular
- Top 1%: Bone mass
- Top 1%: Sleep
- Top 1%: Combined clinical markers

Below is a summary of my health protocol, written so that you can follow the parts that are suitable to you. My team and I built this over several years. We analyzed all the longevity scientific literature, ranking the highest performing. Because when there are seemingly endless “good” things one can do for their health, it’s valuable to have a filter and sorting approach to focus on the power laws. The 20% of things that account for 80% of the benefits. After assessing the scientific literature, we endeavored to measure the biological age of all my 70+ organs. One can be chronologically 46 and have a heart that is biologically 37 (which is my case). Then we implemented all the best science and measured the biological age of my organs again. We did this again, and again and again until I became the most biologically measured person in history. Now, I’m going to share everything I learned with you, for free. Here we go.

## Power Laws

### Master These 5 Habits
The scientific evidence points at mastering the basics.

- Sleep - consistent, high quality sleep is your #1 life priority.
- Diet - eat a Blueprint (Mediterranean) like diet with the Blueprint stack. Example foods include vegetables, fruits, nuts, legumes (beans, chickpeas, lentils), lean proteins, and extra virgin olive oil.
- Exercise - 6 hours a week. Incorporate strength, cardio, flexibility and balance. 
- Family, friendship and community - actively foster meaningful relationships. 
- Things to avoid - fast food, junk food, smoking, vaping, excessive alcohol and social media - and anything addictive.

## Move on from Bad Habits
Years ago I could not stop myself from overeating everyday at 7 pm. One day out of desperation, I said “Evening Bryan, you’re fired. You make my life miserable. I can’t sleep. I’m 60 lbs overweight and I feel awful all the time.” Giving that version of me a name and then writing down his persuasive tactics such as “tonight is the last night” or “tomorrow we’ll work extra hard to burn off the calories” gave me the tools I needed to stand my ground. Evening Bryan’s authority to eat between 5 pm and 10 pm was revoked. No matter what, Evening Bryan cannot eat food because if given the chance, he’ll eat too much and ruin life for Sleep Bryan, Morning Bryan, Work Bryan and Dad Bryan.  We all have bad habits. Things we do that we don’t really want to do. They never actually make us happy. They in fact make us sad and regretful.

### Here’s one approach to move past your bad habits:
- Identify a version of you that is responsible for self destructive behavior and give them a name (i.e. Evening Bryan).
- Write down the persuasion techniques they use to get what they want (“today’s the last day"). 
- Prepare a list of rebuttals that enables you to stand your ground (“this is not what we really want”, “we know this makes us sad and regretful”). 
- Identify which versions of you should be in charge (i.e. Morning you) and give them the authority to make decisions on behalf of your Evening Bryan.
