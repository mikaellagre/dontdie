# Blueprint - Hair
Start early and be proactive - I made the mistake of addressing my hair loss and graying after noticing it. By age 20, about 20% of men already have some visible hair loss. Many people lose up to 50% of their hair before they start to notice thinning. By age 50, up to 40% of women will have noticeable hair loss. Consider starting a hair health protocol before you can visibly detect loss. 

## Nutrition
Proper nutrition is important for hair health. You’ll want to make sure you’re getting adequate protein, Omega-3 fatty acids, Biotin (Vitamin B7), Vitamin C, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, Iron, Zinc and Biotin. The Blueprint stack has all of these. 

## Topical hair formulation
I use a topical solution, 1 mL applied to my scalp each morning (before bed is ok too). I then massage my scalp with a silicon scrubber for 1-2 minutes to stimulate blood flow. The formulation I use (listed below) is based upon a genetic test I completed (Blueprint 30% off) that predicted my response to various ingredients. The company then provides you with your custom Rx formulation. 
Note I experimented with applying the topical 2x a day (morning and night) and my recent blood results showed my DHT levels too low at 5.8 ng/dL which can create side effects. I’m back at 1x daily and will retest my blood in 90 days.  If you’re on a budget or just want a basic solution, you can try out Minoxidil 5%. Note that some people experience side effects with a topical such as itchy skin, headaches etc. so monitor for those. 
The ingredients in my formulation: Minoxidil (7%), Cetirizine HCl (1%), Latanoprost (0.004%), Dutasteride (0.25%), Melatonin (0.1%), Caffeine (0.2%), Tretinoin (0.0125%), Vitamin D3 (1,000IU/ML), Vitamin E (10 IU/ML). 

## Red light cap
Six minutes a day and you can be doing your morning routine as you wear it.

## Oral Minoxidil
I take 3.75 mg a day. I started with 2.5 mg and evaluated for side effects. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial involving 90 men with androgenetic alopecia AGA, oral minoxidil (5 mg daily) was found to have similar efficacy to topical minoxidil (5% solution applied twice daily) after 24 weeks. Oral minoxidil is generally considered safe at low doses, but it can have side effects. Common side effects include hypertrichosis (excessive hair growth) and headaches. 
If you want to start oral Minoxidil, you can get the Rx from our friend Dr. Marjon Vatanchi, Irvine Dermatology. 949-800-8551, Concierge@irvinedermatology.com.

## Gray hair reversal
I’ve been using this product (7% discount “Blueprint”) and have seen good results reversing my gray hair. I was around 70% gray and now about 30% gray. Others have told me that it didn’t do anything for them.  If you try it, please share your results so that we have more of us learning of its efficacy. 
Blueprint hair health shampoo is possibly coming soon. We’ve been trailing this formulation and think it’s the best out there. We need to complete our assessment and if it passes, we’ll make it available to you later this year. 

## Conclusions
Blueprint hair treatment is also in the works - I was doing PRP and PRF, where you draw blood and then separate out the plasma and then reinject the plasma back into your scalp. After diligently doing it for 12 months, we saw nearly no benefit. That stinks because it’s painful, expensive and time consuming. Seems PRP works for some but not all.  So we turned our attention to another method that we’re excited about. We are completing our final assessment on this too and if it passes, will also be released later this year. 
This protocol has worked remarkably well for me. That said, I know many people take oral finasteride and have good results. Luckily I’ve been able to avoid it and the risk of its side effects. 
As with any new therapy, you’ll want to monitor for side effects. I’m doing multiple things simultaneously but that doesn’t mean you need to. Topical minoxidil 5% may be the only thing you need for good results. My objective is to openly share what I’m experimenting with so that you can decide what’s right for you.  We’re still in the early days of anti-aging and likely know far less than we think we know. It’s helpful to remain humble. 
A final note that I’m in touch with several companies that are building novel hair regrowth therapies. They are promising and exciting. They’re still years out but it’s cool to think that hair loss may no longer be a thing we have to think about. Just one reason why the future is going to be amazing. #dontdie
Good luck to you friends. Wishing you each the best in maintaining a full head of vibrant hair.

# Blueprint - Skin
Is skincare about looking good? 
Skincare is important because our skin is the first line of defense against the outside world. Healthy skin protects us from infection, regulates our body temperature, and even helps us feel sensations. Poor skin health can lead to a host of problems, from premature aging to serious health issues like skin cancer. Skin cancer can be a real and dangerous consequence of excessive sun exposure without protection. Taking care of your skin isn’t just about looking good—it’s about staying healthy. Looking your best is a great secondary benefit.
 
## The basics
This may seem like a long list but they’re really all habits that you’ll soon forget you’re doing. 
- Get sunlight early in the mornings and later in the afternoons
- Avoid direct sun exposure when the UV index is high (10 am - 4 pm)
- If in the sun during high UV times, use a UV umbrella or wear a hat + mineral sunscreen
- Prioritize your sleep
- And eat a healthy diet
- Avoid junk/fried/highly processed foods.
- Consume 20-30 grams of collagen peptides daily. It’s good to pair Vitamin C with peptides, which the Blueprint stack has. Also, Blueprint collagen peptides are coming soon.
- Supplements: Niacinamide (15 mg in Blueprint Essential Capsules) and hyaluronic acid (120 mg in Blueprint Longevity Mix)


## My daily protocol
- AM face wash morning & night. (Link)
- Moisturize: (Body, Face)
- Sunscreen
- Creams - a few worth considering: niacinamide, vitamin C, hyaluronic acid and tretinoin (an Rx). There are seemingly endless skin cream options to choose from and my experience has been that they are only marginally helpful. If you find one that is meaningfully effective, please share! Note: if you have your face wash or moisturizer that you like, great. The above are options. 

## Pro tips
- Other UV Protection: UV-tinted windows (blocks 99% of UV) and a UV umbrella when outside.
- Prescription: I microdose Accutane (40mg weekly) for blemish free skin and anti-aging benefits. Requires a doctor’s prescription. Alternatives include over-the-counter retinols. (Link)
- Red Light Therapy: Three 12-minute full body sessions per week for collagen production, healing, and mitochondrial health. Note, if you don’t have easy access to red light therapy, don’t worry. The basics are a great place to start.

## Measuring skin health
We measure my progress and tailor treatments with Multispectral Imaging. It provides detailed views of skin health, tracking UV damage, pore size, and spots. Reveals much more than the eyes can see. Some wellness clinics offer this service, you can search locally to find one.

## Advanced Protocols 
Some advanced therapies we have been experimenting with to target collagen production, skin firmness, and overall skin health.

### Some examples  
- Cream: Trialing Adipeau for facial fat for cell rejuvenation. Awaiting results.
- Exilis: Radio frequency for collagen and tightening. Good option.
- Tixel: Thermal mechanical ablation for improved skin firmness and collagen production. Grade: best combination of safety and efficacy.
- IPL: Full body sessions to invite younger genetic expression. Grade: promising.

With this you’ll be off to a great start.


## Sunlight is good
Sunlight helps the skin produce vitamin D. This is good for bones and immune health. It can increase serotonin, a hormone that promotes mood and calmness. Natural light helps regulate our circadian rhythm which improves sleep quality.

## Sunlight is bad
UV rays from the sun break down collagen and elastin. This leads to wrinkles, sagging, and general skin aging.
Large amounts of UV also increase the risk of skin cancers, such as melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma.

## Tips to get the good without the bad
- Get sun exposure when the UV index is below 3; early mornings and late afternoons.
- Don’t get burned.
- When the UV index is >4, wear a hat or use a UV umbrella.
- Use a UV light in the morning to promote your circadian rhythm without the sun. I use a 10k Lux Carex lamp.
- You can supplement your Vitamin D levels. I take 2,000 IU daily.
- Use sunscreen that protects against UVA and UVB. I use EltaMD.
- Use a mineral sunscreen if possible.
- A burn is potentially more dangerous than a chemical sunscreen. Try to avoid both.
- If you dislike sunscreen, refer to 1, 2, and 3.


 
# Blueprint - Oral
My teeth have caused me a lot of anxiety. When I first started Blueprint I was not in a good place. My gums were receding, my teeth were eroding, and my diet was full of sugar. I felt helpless and it was hard to look at my teeth in the mirror. If you feel similarly: you are not alone. Caring for your teeth is manageable and reversing damage is possible. 


## After three years on Blueprint
- My dentist reports “you have the gums of a healthy teenager”
- My plaque index is 24.4% which is ideal
- I solved the destructive bruxism I dealt with for 20 years  
- My gingival and calculus index was 0, the lowest possible and equal to an 18 year old
- And I’ve reduced my attachment loss by 41%

This is important because keeping your mouth healthy is key to overall health. Optimal oral care can prevent tooth decay, gum disease, and even lower your risk of heart disease. 


## Here is how you can achieve similar results:

With anything with Blueprint, it’s important to understand your baseline. Ask your dentist to evaluate: 

### Attachment loss
The loss of supportive tissue around teeth. Poor attachment can lead to tooth loss if severe.

### Pocket depth
Measures from the top of the gum line to the bottom of the pocket where the gum attaches to the tooth. Healthy gums have a pocket depth of 1-3 mm. Three years ago I had several pockets that were 5 mm deep.

### Plaque index
Measures the thickness of dental plaque on the tooth’s surface.  My dentist stained my mouth with a solution that reveals the plaque. She then assigned numbers to the various levels of plaque and on what parts of the teeth. My plaque levels were ideal. 

### Gums bleed
You want gums that don’t bleed easily. A good sign was that my dentist continually poked my gums trying to get them to bleed but was unsuccessful. She mentioned that my gum health is better than many of the teenagers she sees, setting aside those with bad oral health habits.

## Oral care protocol
Nine steps you can follow to get your oral health in order:

### 1. Waterpik
The first thing I do in my protocol is use a water pick. It uses a high-pressure stream of water to remove food, plaque, and bacteria from hard-to-reach places. Morning & night.

### 2. Floss
After using the Waterpik to loosen particles, I use floss for plaque and debris removal. I use Dr. Tongue's because it's thicker and showed a 25%+ increase in plaque removal in studies we reviewed. Morning & night. 

### 3. Brush
I use an electric brush, but you may prefer a manual. I enjoy soft bristles as it cleans effectively without unneeded harshness on the tooth or gums. Morning & night.

### 4. Toothpaste
I am currently using two types of toothpastes, neither of which have fluoride. Morning & night.

### 5. Tongue Scraper
This is a game changer. If it’s not part of your oral routine, I encourage you to try. It can significantly improve oral hygiene. Morning & night.

### 6. Mouthwash
If you plan on smooching that special someone, you can freshen up with a Xylitol mouthwash. Give your partner the very best. Morning & night.

### 7. Tea Tree Oil
I previously used tea tree oil, 2-3 drops with 2 oz of water. Recently I discontinued using it. Years ago it helped improve my oral health. Now that my baseline is back to ideal I have not needed it in my protocol.

### 8. Bruxism Device
For 20 years I was grinding my teeth at night. If you have Bruxism, I strongly encourage you to address it. A dentist on Blueprint recommended the SomnoDent Bruxism Device, and for the first time in my life, my Bruxism has stopped. Wear while sleeping.

### 9. Cleanings
Make sure you visit your dentist at least 2 times a year. It is important to identify problems early and remove hardened plaque. Even with diligent brushing and flossing at home, it's difficult to remove all plaque from your teeth.
 

## Oral Hygiene Tips

### Reduce sugar
Try sugar alternatives like Trehalose, Monk Fruit, Xylitol, and Allulose. 

### Acidic Liquid
Avoid extended exposure to acidic fluids, such as coffee and lemon water.

### Avoid dry mouth
Staying hydrated. Saliva protects your teeth by washing away food debris, neutralizing acid, carrying essential ions like calcium, which help remineralize your enamel, making it stronger.

### Wait to brush
I avoid brushing my teeth 30 minutes after eating as tooth enamel is temporarily softened. 

### Travel Toothbrush
If I spend the day on-the-go, I’ll take a travel toothbrush with me. Throughout the day you can sneak away to a bathroom and give your teeth a clean. 
 

Follow these steps and you’ll be off to a great start.


# Blueprint - Heart
Hi Friend,

My heart recovers faster than 75% of elite athletes and 99% of the general population.
This biomarker, known as Heart Rate Recovery (HRR), is a key indicator of cardiovascular fitness.

Here is what you can do to measure, compare, and improve yours.



## What is Heart Rate Recovery?
HRR is a marker that indicates how quickly your heart rate drops back to resting heart rate after exercise, indicating cardiovascular fitness and health.
My HRR is 37 bpm which is higher than 75% of elite athletes and 99% of the general population.


## How to Measure your (HRR)
1. Exercise vigorously
2. Record peak heart rate
3. Rest 1 minute
4. Record heart rate again
5. Subtract second reading from peak

The result is your 1-minute HRR in bpm.


## Here’s how you can improve your HRR
### 1. Exercise
Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise per week.

### 2. Diet
Focus on foods for cardiac health, including healthy fats: omega3 from nuts, fish and supplements, in addition to extra virgin olive oil (EVOO).
Polyphenols from EVOO, berries and dark chocolate support recovery due to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.
Diet of vegetables, fruits and lean proteins.

### 3. Sleep
Get enough (7-8 hours) of high-quality night sleep to allow for full recovery in support of your exercise goals.
Keep a regular sleep schedule.
Have an effective wind-down routine for maximal recovery. Follow my full sleep routine here.

### 4. Additional considerations:
- Hydration
- Exogenous ketones can help boost your performance
- Limit processed foods
- Limit caffeine

## What does poor HRR indicate?
Increased all-cause mortality and heart attack risk.
Low HRR can be associated to one or more of the following:
- Coronary Artery Disease
- Heart Failure
- Hypertension
- Metabolic Syndrome
- Diabetes
- Sleep Apnea

In a landmark NEJM study with over 2000 mid-aged participants with an initial heart condition, poor HRR following activity was a strong predictor of all-cause mortality, with a 400% increase in mortality risk within the 6 year follow-up period.

## Science Summary
Heart Rate Recovery is an indicator of the autonomous functioning of the heart, and it results in the withdrawal of the so-called sympathetic activity and the reactivation of the parasympathetic nervous activity.
The latter is responsible for the ability to relax. Evidence using specific blockers indicates that the reactivation of parasympathetic activity is the main driver of immediate Heart Rate Recovery, while the withdrawal of sympathetic activity comes later in play to affect the longer term HRR.

Focus on the power laws of sleep, nutrition and exercise and you’ll be off to a great start.
